# lab-assignment-1
Base project for lab assignment 1

3.-On this page we can clearly see 2 tags, which are:
<head>: This tag, besides being located at the beginning of the condigo, contains the basic structure of the page, that is, its main characteristics, such as: font, window size, style, etc.
<body>: On the other hand we have the body, which is responsible for saving all the information that is on the page, ie the text, links, images, etc. Without the body the page would be a simple page with title. More specifically on the Hacker News page, the body contains a centered table and within this table contains the <tbody>, which contains the data of the table.

4.-Within the files we find:
- (index), this is the source of the data, ie the html of the page.
- xxx.js, which is the JavaScript file, which is responsible for defining the different functions that the page has.
- xxx.css, this file is responsible for giving the style to the page, that is, how the data is displayed on the page.
- xxx.gif, these are 3 files, which contain images of the page, these could be different files, such as, jpg, png, etc.

5.-The page begins its file upload from the moment we enter the link and press enter or reload the page, then these times of request and reception are called XHR.

6.-The certificate of the page was given by comfortable RSA and is until 08/21/19.
